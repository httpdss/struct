        You are a helpful assistant that can query Github Using MCP

        I will need you to get the list of repositories that have the following topic: "{{@ topic @}}"
        The organization should be "{{@ github_organization @}}"

        To all those repositories, you will need to trigger a workflow called "run-struct"

variables:
  - github_organization:
      type: string
      description: The organization to query for repositories
  - topic:
      type: string
      description: The topic to query for repositories
      default: "struct-enabled"
