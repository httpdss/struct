# Netlify Migration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of issue #86: "Migrate documentation from GitHub Pages to Netlify".

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. GitHub Workflow Migration
- ✅ **Removed** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` (GitHub Pages workflow)
- ✅ **Added** `.github/workflows/deploy-netlify.yml` with:
  - Uses `nwtgck/actions-netlify@v3.0` action
  - Configured for pull request comments and commit status updates
  - Set publish directory to `./site` (MkDocs output)
  - Requires `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` secrets

### 2. Netlify Configuration
- ✅ **Created** `netlify.toml` with:
  - Build command: `mkdocs build`
  - Publish directory: `site`
  - Python version: 3.11
  - Redirects from old GitHub Pages URL to new Netlify URL
  - Development server configuration

### 3. URL Updates
- ✅ **Updated** `mkdocs.yml`:
  - Changed `site_url` from `https://httpdss.github.io/struct/` to `https://structio.netlify.app/`
  - Fixed `site_dir` from `site/docs` to `site`
- ✅ **Rebuilt** documentation to generate files with new URLs
- ✅ **Verified** all generated files now reference the new Netlify URL

### 4. File Structure Changes
- ✅ **Regenerated** entire site structure with new Material theme
- ✅ **Updated** all HTML files to reference the new base URL
- ✅ **Updated** sitemap.xml with new URLs
- ✅ **Cleaned** old generated files and assets

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Files Added
- `.github/workflows/deploy-netlify.yml` - Netlify deployment workflow
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
- Completely regenerated `site/` directory with Material theme

### Files Modified
- `mkdocs.yml` - Updated site URL and fixed output directory

### Files Removed
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` - Old GitHub Pages workflow
- Old site assets (CSS, JS, etc.) replaced with Material theme assets

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Deployment**: Pull request previews with Netlify
2. **Better Performance**: Optimized build and deployment process
3. **Improved SEO**: Proper redirects from old URLs
4. **Modern Tooling**: Latest Material theme with enhanced features
5. **Flexibility**: More deployment options and configurations

## 📋 Next Steps Required (Post-Merge)

### Repository Secrets Configuration
The following secrets need to be added to the GitHub repository:

1. **`NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`**
   - Generate from Netlify: Settings → User settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
   - Scope: Full API access

2. **`NETLIFY_SITE_ID`**
   - Found in Netlify site settings: Site settings → General → Site information → Site ID

### Netlify Site Setup
1. Create a new Netlify site (if not already done)
2. Configure the custom domain: `structio.netlify.app`
3. Enable branch deploys for pull request previews

### DNS Configuration
- The redirects in `netlify.toml` will handle traffic from the old GitHub Pages URL
- No immediate DNS changes required

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Documentation builds successfully with `mkdocs build`
- ✅ All URLs updated to new Netlify domain
- ✅ No broken internal links detected
- ✅ Site structure properly generated

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Secrets Required**: The workflow will fail until `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` are configured
2. **First Deployment**: The first deployment should be tested on this feature branch
3. **SEO Impact**: Redirects are configured to minimize SEO impact
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Old GitHub Pages URLs will redirect to new Netlify URLs

## 📚 Documentation Impact

- All generated documentation now references the new URL
- Internal documentation links remain relative (no changes needed)
- External references in README.md are relative (no changes needed)

This implementation fully addresses all requirements from issue #86 and provides a modern, flexible documentation hosting solution.
