# GitHub Integration

STRUCT can seamlessly integrate with GitHub to automate the generation of project structures across repositories.

## Automating STRUCT

Combine GitHub Actions with STRUCT to automate project structure generation in CI/CD pipelines. Trigger the process manually or automatically based on events like pull requests or pushes.

Example Workflow:

```yaml
name: run-struct

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  generate:
    uses: httpdss/struct/.github/workflows/struct-generate.yaml@main
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.STRUCT_RUN_TOKEN }}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Secure Your Token**: Store GitHub tokens in secrets management tools.
2. **Use Topics for Filtering**: Organize repositories with topics to efficiently manage workflows.
3. **Test Locally First**: Simulate script actions with `--dry-run` before executing in a CI/CD environment.
4. **Combine with Other Tools**: Use STRUCT with Terraform, Ansible, or Docker for comprehensive project management.
